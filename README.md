# **Kivymd_Opencv**
### To get support for Vanilla Kivy check the kivy_compatible branch

### Description
* This is my first github repository so I am uploading this just as a demo.
* This is a collection of some python files that demonstrates the working of Kivy with OpenCv.
* Common usage would be:
    - Camara app
    - Surveillance monitor
    - As code template
* The utils.py provides basic video capture and manipulation function made with OpenCv.
* All the code is free to use. 

### Installing python modules and dependancies
* See the requirements.txt for the dependancies
* Or simply run the following command in terminal to install all the dependancies:

```
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
